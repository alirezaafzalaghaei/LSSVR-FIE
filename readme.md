# Implementation of LS-SVR for solving Integral Equations

This repository contains the implementation of the method which is presented in the following paper:

> A new approach to the numerical solution of Fredholm integral equations using least squares-support vector regression

It extends a powerful machine learning method known as least squares support vector regression (LS-SVR) to solve Fredholm integral equations. In this repository, we implemented the algorithm in the `Maple` software.


## Notes
* The repository may be updated in the future. 
* Please open an issue if you found any bugs.
